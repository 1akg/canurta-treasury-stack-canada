# Bitcoin Treasury Standard Canada

## Canurta Helping Consult Canadian Companies on Bitcoin Treasury Standards

## Welcome Message

Hello Everyone, I am Akeem Gardner, CEO & Founder of Canurta Therapeutics. And this is from me to you, a quick onboarding to the **Bitcoin Standard for Canadian Companies.**

For many of us, especially those from my communities, traditional financial systems haven’t always been built with us in mind. They’ve created barriers, not bridges. Being able to self-custody your long-term capital helps you flip the script. It gives us the tools to protect and grow our wealth on our own terms—and opens the door to real economic freedom that we can pass down for generations.

For founders, creatives, and small businesses, this is a game changer. It means no middlemen, no waiting on approvals, and no unnecessary risk from systems we didn’t design. It gives you the flexibility and control you need to build boldly and adapt quickly in a fast-changing world.

Bitcoin held in self-custody on your corporate balance sheet helps connect us across backgrounds and sectors—with shared values like transparency, resilience, and trust in code over institutions. It’s not just financial tech—it’s a mindset. One that says: we’re ready to lead.
